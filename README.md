### Interactive Data Visualization with Plotly

For this submission (Assignment 3), I explored interactive visualization with Plotly. I also explored some of the other possibilities mentioned in the assignment, including blogdown websites, although I did not have time to implement this here.

* Please view the **data-viz_study-01_interactivity_2** file with the "1" suffix. 
* Note that I could not get the html file set up as a Github Page without settings privileges.
